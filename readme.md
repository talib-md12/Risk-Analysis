## Dataset link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/loan-defaulter?select=columns_description.csv

This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of financial data related to default risk. The EDA process involves visualizing and summarizing the data to gain insights and identify patterns that may influence default predictions.

## Data Exploration
The EDA phase includes exploring the distribution of key variables such as credit scores, income levels, debt-to-income ratios, loan amounts, and payment histories. Visualizations like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots are used to analyze the data distribution and relationships.

## Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis techniques are applied to calculate summary statistics, correlations between variables, and identify potential trends or anomalies in the data. Descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing may be used to uncover patterns related to default risk.

## Visualization
Various visualization techniques are employed to represent the data visually. This includes bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, and correlation matrices to highlight relationships and trends within the dataset.

## Data Quality Assessment
The EDA process also involves assessing data quality issues such as missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies. Data cleaning steps may be performed to ensure the integrity and reliability of the analysis.

## Insights
The EDA phase aims to provide valuable insights into the financial data and its relationship to default risk. These insights may guide further feature selection, modeling strategies, and risk assessment approaches.
